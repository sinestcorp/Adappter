# Adappter

## Problem:
First, due to centralization, users are not compensated for their contribution. Second, even if the user's personal information is used without consent, it is unknown. Third, it is difficult for small and medium-sized developers to succeed due to structure problems in global industry. Individuals are rewarded for their contributions, privacy is reliable, and small and medium-sized developers find a key for success within the adapter platform. 

## Solution:
Adappter will provide a solution that helps individuals, companies, sellers, and users coexist with each other for the objective of happiness and profits of all based on the spirit of fairness, sharing, and trust. Also, Adappter will make every effort to increase the value of all members.

# ADP(Adappter Token)
ADP is Token published by Adappter, operated within the Ethereum platform (ERC20), and used as a key currency in the adapter ecosystem. It can convert AP, which was received as compensation for partner contents, to ADP and it will continue for 20 years. In the future, it will provide real-life payment functions for purchasing goods, items, and products.

# AP(Activity Point)
As a reward point for all activities within the service, it can be obtained for a certain period of time(2 weeks). At the end of the Nth season, ADP will be provided fairly according to the contribution level. The AP payment policy is continuously updated according to the compensation engine and Eco-System's compensation policy in the Adappter Core, and announced on the official website.
